# Backend perf test

The aim of this repo is to collect different technologies and test them against 
each other in similar/same environments.

In order to make it fair, all future technologies should implement same functionality as node.
Which means:
1. singe core
2. multi thread
3. all cores
4. all cores with multi threads
